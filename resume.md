## **PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY**

Senior Software Architect with over 15 years of experience bridging the gap between mission-critical hardware (OT) and modern AI architecture (IT). I possess a unique dual background: serving as **Lead Software Architect** for Ambev's proprietary Computer Vision Platform (**SODA Vision**), while simultaneously deploying custom Edge AI solutions for global clients through my specialized consultancy, **Baunilha Systems**.

My expertise goes beyond training models; I engineer **entire ecosystems**. I specialize in building robust, offline-first architectures that solve physical problems in the real world, having deployed solutions for **Colgate-Palmolive (USA/Mexico)**, **Petrobras**, and **Infraero**.

## **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

### **Baunilha Systems | *Founder* & Lead *AI Engineer***

*Remote / Brazil (Contractor) | 2023 – Present*

*Founded* a specialized engineering *consultancy focused on delivering custom Industrial AI and complete IoT ecosystems for global clients.*

* **Global Edge AI Deployment (Colgate-Palmolive):**  
  * Architected and deployed a Deep Learning visual inspection system to replace legacy sensors in high-speed production lines.  
  * **Execution:** Traveled on-site to **USA** facilities to oversee the physical installation, calibration, and validation of Edge AI hardware (**GPU-accelerated Industrial PCs**).  
  * **Impact:** Significantly reduced false rejection rates and enabled real-time quality analytics.  
* **Marvitech Platform (Full-Stack Architecture):**  
  * **IoT Fleet Management:** Engineered a robust fleet management system for Raspberry Pi devices using **Balena IoT**, ensuring reliable OTA updates and remote telemetry for distributed vending machines.  
  * **Platform Architecture:** Architected a multi-tenant backend using **.NET 9** (Clean Architecture/DDD) and **PostgreSQL**, orchestrated with Docker and Traefik.  
  * **Mobile Engineering:** Developed an **offline-first mobile app** using **Flutter** (Riverpod), implementing background synchronization to guarantee operation in areas with poor connectivity.
  * Orchestrated the entire infrastructure using Docker and Traefik, ensuring secure data ingestion from mobile app and vending machines.

### **Ambev Tech (AB InBev) | *Software Architect & Tech Lead***

*Brazil | Jun 2016 – Present*

*Leading the engineering of **SODA Vision**, the company's proprietary end-to-end Computer Vision platform used by continuous improvement teams across factories worldwide.*

* **Platform Architecture (SODA Vision):**  
  * Designed the entire ecosystem architecture, decoupling the Cloud-based Editor (React/TensorFlow) from the deterministic Edge Runner (Python/C++), ensuring reliable execution on constrained hardware.  
* **Proprietary DSL Design (Vision Flow):**  
  * Created "Vision Flow," a Domain-Specific Language to standardize industrial vision pipelines. This enabled distinct modules (Vision ML, Studio PDI, and AI Models) to run on a unified, versioned engine.  
* **Edge Engineering (Soda Lens):**  
  * Developed the "Soda Lens" architecture—a standardized sensor node implementation that executes inference offline and publishes results via **OPC** UA to the industrial ETL.  
* **Innovation:**  
  * Co-invented the "LAHBS Box," an intrapreneurship program that successfully scaled into a commercial offering for external markets.

### **Bosch Rexroth / TTM / Mayekawa | *Automation Engineer & Tech Lead***

*Brazil | 2007 – 2016*

*Engineered high-reliability control software for critical infrastructure and heavy industry projects.*

* **Petrobras (Offshore Oil & Gas):**  
  * Developed automation logic for Hydraulic Power Units (HPU) managing subsea manifolds for the **P-55 Platform** (Roncador Module III). Implemented fail-safe redundancy protocols for mission-critical operations.  
* **Infraero** (Aerospace):  
  * Developed the automation system for the **Fênix AP1 Firefighting Truck**, ensuring 100% operational readiness for emergency response vehicles at major Brazilian airports.  
* **Sanitation Infrastructure:**  
  * Delivered sluice automation software for the Berazategui sanitary treatment plant (Buenos Aires).
